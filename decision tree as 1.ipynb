    "A decision tree classifier is a supervised machine learning algorithm used for classification tasks. It works by recursively partitioning the input data into subsets based on the values of their features, ultimately assigning a class label to each subset. Here's how it works:\n",
    "\n",
    "Root Node: At the beginning, the entire dataset is considered, and the algorithm selects the feature that best splits the data into two subsets that are as pure as possible in terms of the target variable (i.e., they have similar class labels).\n",
    "\n",
    "Splitting: The selected feature and its corresponding threshold value are used to create a binary split. Data points that satisfy the condition (e.g., feature > threshold) go to one branch, and those that don't go to the other.\n",
    "\n",
    "Recursive Process: This process of selecting the best feature and threshold and splitting the data continues recursively for each branch until a stopping criterion is met. Common stopping criteria include reaching a maximum depth, having a minimum number of data points in a node, or achieving a certain level of purity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Leaf Nodes: When a stopping criterion is met for a branch, it becomes a leaf node, and it is assigned the class label that is most prevalent among the data points in that node.\n",
    "\n",
    "Prediction: To make predictions for new data points, they are passed down the tree from the root node, following the same feature and threshold comparisons at each internal node, until they reach a leaf node. The class label of the leaf node is the predicted class for the input data point."
